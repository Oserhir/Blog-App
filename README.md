# Developer Blog

The blog is a place for me to record interesting snippets and findings relating to software development and ultimately help with my learning.

The blog was built with ASP.NET MVC, C# and SQL, and utilises a role-based security system which restricts access to certain pages and actions. Any visitor can sign up to the site to allow them to leave comments, whilst only designated Admin users can create blogs and posts. There is also a Moderator role, where the user can moderate comments but cannot create blogs/posts.

The front end was developed with HTML, JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap (utilising a bootstrap template as a starting point). The backend utilises MVC and C#, with a SQLServer database.
